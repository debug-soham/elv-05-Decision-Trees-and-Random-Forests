# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

This task focuses on tree-based models for binary classification using the **Heart Disease dataset**. It includes training and visualizing decision trees, evaluating random forests, and interpreting feature importances.

## 🧠 Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the heart disease dataset.
- Standardized features for better model performance.
- Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** with controlled `max_depth`.
- Visualized the decision tree to interpret splits.
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** and compared performance.
- Plotted **feature importances** from the random forest.
- Used **cross-validation** for robust evaluation.

## 📊 Results
- **Decision Tree CV Score**: `1.0000`
- **Random Forest CV Score**: `0.9971`
- Visuals confirmed top features: `cp`, `ca`, `thalach`, `oldpeak`, `thal`.

## 📁 Files
- `heart_disease.csv` – Raw dataset  
- `Decision Trees and Random Forests.ipynb` – Notebook with all model training, evaluation, and visualization
